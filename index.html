                            <p class="card-text"><strong>HTML</strong> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the
                                standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is
                                often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                                languages such as JavaScript.

                                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
                                the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
                                semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

                                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
                                other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML
                                provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
                                text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements
                                are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce
                                content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about
                                document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags
                                but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
                                affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and
                                layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
                                and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
                                presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
                                video and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>CSS</strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet
                                language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
                                such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a
                                cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
                                colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more
                                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
                                multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                                file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
                                .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the
                                file and its formatting.

                                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
                                page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
                                by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
                                devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a
                                mobile device.

                                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style
                                rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority
                                scheme is predictable.

                                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet
                                media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).
                                The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

                                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML,
                                plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Javascript</strong> JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a
                                programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
                                alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
                                for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
                                have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
                                ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                                first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and
                                imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
                                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
                                Document Object Model (DOM).

                                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
                                storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system
                                provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

                                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core
                                components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime
                                system for this usage is Node.js.

                                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
                                libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

                                what Angular is, what advantages it provides, and what you might expect as you start to
                                build your applications.
                                Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
                                A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
                                A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features,
                                including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
                                A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
                                With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer
                                projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as
                                straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with minimal
                                effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7
                                million developers, library authors, and content creators.
